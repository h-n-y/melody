// TODO

- check status codes for all API responses

- DEFAULT_PAGE constant should be in a single file
- also DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE
--> currently in music.service.ts and search-results-page.component.ts

- check sort order for search results page requests

- need to anticipate a "no results" situation

- make git commits

- document code

- Search Results Page -> num results values
- Search Results Page tab click -> scroll to top

- Musixmatch links

- make sure lyrics pixel image is being used

- search on Enter?

- add additional right-hand padding to search modal search bar --> pushes
  browser cancel button to the left, which is desired

- need to push footer down for short content

- remove localstorage functionality

- remove JSONP-related conditional searches --> just use jsonp all the time

- twitter link should consume click event on artist table row

- consider searching tracks + lyrics simultaneously -> could return better
  search results. Example: Searching 'rooster alice in chains' won't return
that song if searching query in lyrics and tracks *separately*. Look at the
musixmatch api for potential options.

- remove pointer events on note icon in track details page to allow scrolling
